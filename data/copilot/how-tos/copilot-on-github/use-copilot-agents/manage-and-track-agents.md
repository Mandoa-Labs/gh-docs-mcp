# Manage and track Copilot cloud agent sessions

Monitor your agent's progress in real time, steer it with follow-up prompts, and stop or archive sessions.

Use the agents panel on GitHub to start, monitor, and manage agent sessions across your repositories.

## Monitor agent activity

Track sessions from the agents panel (available from any page on GitHub) or from the [agents page](https://github.com/copilot/agents?ref_product=copilot\&ref_type=engagement\&ref_style=text). Sessions that you started, or that another user prompted Copilot to work on, appear in your sessions list.

Click a session to open the session log and overview, where you can monitor the agent's progress, token usage, and session length.

## Review session logs

Session logs show Copilot's internal reasoning and the tools it used to understand your repository, make changes, and validate its work. Copilot has its own ephemeral development environment, so it can run automated tests and linters to validate changes before pushing.

## Trace commits to session logs

Commits from Copilot cloud agent are authored by Copilot, with the person who started the task listed as co-author. Each commit message includes a link to the session logs, so you can trace why a change was made during code review or an audit. Commits are signed and appear as "Verified" on GitHub.

## Steer an agent session

If Copilot is heading in the wrong direction, or you realize your original prompt needs adjusting, you can redirect it without stopping the session.

1. Open the [agents page](https://github.com/copilot/agents?ref_product=copilot\&ref_type=engagement\&ref_style=text) and select the session.

2. In the prompt box below the session log, type your follow-up. For example:

   ```text
   Use our existing ErrorHandler utility class instead of writing custom try-catch blocks for each endpoint.
   ```

3. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Copilot implements your input after it finishes its current tool call.

Each steering message uses **one premium request**. Steering is not available for third-party coding agents.

## Stop a session

If the task no longer needs to be done, or you want to start over with a new prompt, click **Stop session** in the session log viewer. Stopping a session ends the GitHub Actions run and preserves any commits already pushed.

## Archive sessions

Archive stopped sessions to remove them from your sessions list.

1. Open the stopped session.
